# C# / .NET

Load for a task that changes .NET code or its public interfaces.

## Discover before planning

- Inspect `global.json`, solution/project files, shared build properties, package management, CI, and repository scripts. Record SDK constraints, target frameworks, affected projects, and actual verification commands in the task packet.
- Identify the test runner and any required local services from the repository. Use project commands and installed SDK help to select supported options; do not assume one test runner or CLI flag set.
- Preserve the existing application architecture, web framework, persistence approach, and dependency-management conventions. Choose these explicitly during analysis only when starting a new application.

## Implementation and contracts

- Follow established dependency lifetimes, asynchronous execution, cancellation, validation, and error responses. Give shared package files and schema migrations a single owner.
- For REST, locate the existing OpenAPI contract or generation source; for gRPC, locate `.proto` files and code generation. Agree on DTOs, errors, authorization expectations, and compatibility before delegating dependent client/server work. Preserve another established contract approach when present.
- Review resource-level authorization, over-posting or unintended field binding, query construction, secret handling, and sensitive logging where relevant. Consider migration compatibility when changing persistence.

## Verification

- Run the repository's build, test, and analyzer commands for the affected projects, followed by the agreed integration checks. Discover formatting and dependency-audit commands from existing tooling and the installed SDK before selecting options.
- Test observable behavior, affected validation and authorization paths, and persistence or transport boundaries when changed. Reuse existing fixtures and service setup.
- State which frameworks and configurations were checked. Missing SDKs, restore access, or integration dependencies are blockers for those checks, not passing results. Do not upgrade the SDK or packages just to make verification run.
